<BODY bgColor=#ffffff leftMargin=40 link=#500000 vLink=#505050>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>

<P>This sample uses three HTML files:</P>
</FONT>
<UL>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>
    <LI>NoTheme.htm is a simple HTML page that uses three 
    different levels of headers and bullets.
    <LI>Theme1.htm uses the same HTML tags as NoTheme.htm 
    but has the Travel theme applied to it.
    <LI>Theme2.htm uses the Nature theme. 
</FONT></LI></UL>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>
<P>When a theme is applied to an HTML page or the entire 
Web project, files are copied into the Themes directory of the project. Most of 
the files are graphics, but there are also some cascading style sheets.
<P>The key to the theme is the cascading style sheet (.css) 
file. The themes in this example use these different style sheets to create the 
theme:
<P><FONT face=Courier>&lt;link 
REL=&quot;stylesheet&quot; TYPE=&quot;text/css&quot; 
HREF=&quot;_Themes/travel/COLOR0.CSS&quot; VI6.0THEME=&quot;barcode&quot;&gt;<BR>&lt;link REL=&quot;stylesheet&quot; 
TYPE=&quot;text/css&quot; HREF=&quot;_Themes/travel/GRAPH0.CSS&quot; 
VI6.0THEME=&quot;barcode&quot;&gt; <BR>&lt;link 
REL=&quot;stylesheet&quot; TYPE=&quot;text/css&quot; 
HREF=&quot;_Themes/travel/THEME.CSS&quot; VI6.0THEME=&quot;barcode&quot;&gt; <BR>&lt;link REL=&quot;stylesheet&quot; 
TYPE=&quot;text/css&quot; HREF=&quot;_Themes/travel/CUSTOM.CSS&quot; 
VI6.0THEME=&quot;barcode&quot;&gt;</FONT> 
</P>

<P>The first linked file (COLOR0.CSS) sets the colors for 
links (regular, active, and visited), the six different heading levels (H1-H6), 
table highlight and shadow colors, and body background color. 
<P>The second linked file (GRAPH0.CSS) sets the image and 
font information for banner and non-graphical navigation controls. 
<P>The third linked file (THEME.CSS) sets the font family 
for the body, the six heading levels and the background image. 
<P>All the graphical navigation controls are in the final 
linked file (CUSTOM.CSS) along with all the bullet levels. 
</FONT></P>
