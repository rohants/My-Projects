<P>This sample uses one file, GuestBk.asp. It creates an HTML form to allow users to type in their name and any comments they would like to make. The information is then stored in a database. The user is also given the opportunity to view other comments entered by previous visitors.
<P>The Recordset design-time control is used to create the connection to the database. If the mode of the form is set for input, then an HTML form is displayed for data entry. If the mode of the form is output, then the Grid design-time control is used to display the contents of the guest book table.
