<P>This sample uses one file: Grid.asp. This file uses two 
major design-time controls. </P>

<P>The Recordset design-time control is used to connect to 
the Products table in the Gallery database. </P>

<P>The Grid design-time control is bound to the recordset to 
display all the records in the table. </P>

<P>There are four buttons on the screen that call some of 
the available methods exposed by the Grid control. </P>
<UL>
    <LI>The first button calls the hide method so that the 
    grid is no longer visible.
    <LI>The second button calls the show method to make the 
    grid visible again.
    <LI>The third button calls the isVisible method and 
    generates an alert box telling the user if the grid is visible or not.
    <LI>The last button calls the bindAllColumns method that 
    will display every column of the grid if they are not all 
displayed.</LI></UL></FONT>
