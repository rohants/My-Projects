<P>This sample uses three files: UserNote.asp, DelNote.asp 
and SendNote.asp. </P>
<UL>
    <LI>UserNote.asp displays messages sent by other 
    members of the organization to the user logged into this page.
    <LI>DelNote.asp deletes messages from the list of 
    stored messages.
    <LI>SendNote.asp stores messages from the user that are 
    to be sent to other users of the organization. </LI></UL>

<P>UserNote.asp uses a recordset control and a data-bound 
grid control to display messages that have been posted for the user. </P>

<P>The messages are retrieved from the UserNote table in 
the Gallery database. The recordset queries the table to find any messages for 
the current user. Below is the SQL statement used to achieve this: </P>

<FONT face=Courier>
function DTCRecordset1_onbeforeopen() { <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; newSQL = &quot;Select * FROM UserNote WHERE 
(TO = '&quot; + Request.ServerVariables(&quot;AUTH_USER&quot;) + &quot;')&quot;; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; DTCRecordset1.setSQL(newSQL); <BR>
} 
</FONT>

<P>If there are no messages for the current user, the grid 
is not displayed and there is only a link to send messages. If there are 
messages for the current user they are displayed in the grid. The grid displays 
the message text as well as who the message is from. There is also an option to 
delete each message. </P>

<P>DelNote.asp is called when the user wants to delete a 
particular message. The ID number of the message is passed to DelNote.asp and 
the corresponding record is deleted from the database. After the message is 
deleted the user is redirected back to the UserNote.asp page. </P>

<P>SendNote.asp uses data-bound controls in conjunction 
with the FormManagervictlFormManagerControl control to store user input into the 
UserNote table. </P>

<P>There are two controls that accept input: a 
textboxvictlTextBoxControl control denotes who the message is being sent to and 
a text area control contains the message. </P>

<P>When addressing the message to another member of your 
organization you must enter both the domain and user name (such as, 
Domain1\User1). This address is not case sensitive. In this example the message 
is limited to 255 characters.</P></FONT>
