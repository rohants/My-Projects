<P>This sample uses one file: Entry.asp. This file uses 
several different design-time controls to browse, edit, and navigate through the 
records in the database.</P>
<P><STRONG>Recordset DTC</STRONG>: This control connects 
the page to the DENTRY table.</P>
<P><STRONG>TextboxDTC</STRONG>: These controls are used to 
display and edit the First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State/Province, and 
Postal Code fields in the DENTRY table. Each of these controls is bound to a 
field in the table.</P>
<P><STRONG>OptionGroup DTC</STRONG>: This control is bound 
to the SEX field in the DENTRY table. Static values of Male and Female are set 
in the properties of the control. They correspond to a 1 for Male and 0 for 
Female in the table.</P>
<P><STRONG>Listbox DTC</STRONG>: This control is set to be 
a drop-down list box and is bound to the INCOME field in the DENTRY table.</P>
<P><STRONG>Checkbox DTC</STRONG>: This control is bound to 
the PC field of the DENTRY table. The value of the field is a bit value to 
determine if the check box should be checked or not.</P>
<P><STRONG>RecordsetNavBar DTC</STRONG>: This control is 
bound to the Recordset DTC to allow the user to step through the records in the 
DENTRY table.</P>
<P><STRONG>FormManager DTC</STRONG>: This control manages 
the entire form. When the form is first viewed, it is in the Browse mode. There 
are two buttons visible at the top of the form that allow you to toggle between 
Browse and Edit modes. When you switch to Edit mode three more buttons become 
visible and the RecordsetNavBar is hidden. The three extra buttons allow you to 
Insert, Delete or Update information in the DENTRY table.<BR>In the FormManager 
properties dialog box the Browse and Edit mode properties are set to enable and 
disable the controls within the form. The Browse mode is also set to be the 
default mode when you enter this Web page.<BR>In the Action tab of the 
FormManager properties dialog box the properties for the buttons are set. Each 
button performs a different set of actions.</P>
<P>The Edit button will enable the controls on the form, 
display three buttons for Insert, Delete and Update, and will also hide the 
RecordsetNavBar.</P>
<P>The Insert button will call the Recordset.AddRecord 
method and then call the Recordset.MoveLast method to allow you to edit the 
newly added record.</P>
<P>The Delete button will call the Recordset.DeleteRecord 
method to delete the currently selected record and then call the 
Recordset.MoveFirst method to display the first record in the recordset.</P>
<P>The Update button calls the Recordset.UpdateRecord 
method to save any changes that have been made to the currently selected record. 
This button needs to be clicked in order to save any changes that have been made 
to a new record that has been created using the Insert button.</P>
<P>The Browse button will disable the controls on the form, 
hide the three editing buttons, and display the RecordsetNavBar.</P>
