<P>This sample uses three files:</P></FONT>
<UL>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>
    <LI>RandomAd.asp displays the randomly selected 
    advertisement.
    <LI>RandomAd.txt defines which advertisements to use.
    <LI>AdRedir.asp redirects the user after an ad is 
    chosen.</FONT></LI></UL>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>
<P>RandomAd.asp uses just two lines of script to display 
the advertisement. The first line creates the object reference to the AdRotator 
component and the second line gets information from the RandomAd.txt file to 
display the ad:
<P>&lt;%Set ad = 
Server.CreateObject(&quot;MSWC.AdRotator&quot;)%&gt;<BR>&lt;%= ad.GetAdvertisement(&quot;RandomAd.txt&quot;) %&gt;</P>  

<P>RandomAd.txt is used as the rotator schedule file. The 
rotator schedule file contains information that the Advertisement Rotator 
component uses to manage and display the various advertisement images. In it, 
you specify the details for the advertisements, such as the size of the 
advertisement space, the image files to use, and the percentage of time that 
each file should be displayed.
<P>The rotator schedule file has two sections: * The first 
section sets parameters that apply to all advertisement images in the rotation 
schedule. * The second section specifies file and location information for each 
individual advertisement and the weight of display time that each advertisement 
should receive. The weight is a number between 0 and 4,294,967,295 that 
indicates the relative weight of the advertisement. 
<P>For example, if a rotator schedule file contains three 
ads with weights set to 2, 3, and 5, the first advertisement is displayed 20 
percent of the time, the second 30 percent of the time, and the third 50 percent 
of the time.
<P>A line containing only an asterisk separates the two 
sections (*). Below is a portion of the RandomAd.txt file that shows one 
advertisement entry:

<P>AdRedir.asp redirects users to the appropriate URL after 
they have clicked on the advertisement.
<P> 
<FONT face=Courier>&lt;%<BR> If 
Request.QueryString(&quot;url&quot;) &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot; Then <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Response.Redirect(Request.QueryString(&quot;url&quot;))<BR> 
End If <BR>%&gt; 
</FONT></P>
<P> can also include script in the redirection file to count 
the number of users that have clicked on a particular advertisement and save 
this information to a file on the server.</FONT></P></FONT>
